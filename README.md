# Day 1

Here is how we can declare the variables in python. Python is an easiest programming language in case of data declaration. Data type in python don't need to declare individually instead it identify the type of data we declared automatically.


##  Variable declaration
#### Declaring string
```python
# Declaring Strings
first_name = "Sudip "
last_name = 'Pradhan '
print(first_name + last_name + 'from Kathmandu')
```
#### Declaring integer
```python
age = 21
print(age)`
a, b,c, d=40,30,20,10
print(a+b+c)  # output = 90
```
#### Declaring float
```python
prize_win = 8200.53
print(prize_win)`
```
#### Listing data
```python
a= [2,3,4,5,6,7]
a[1]=34
print(a)
print(a[2])
```
